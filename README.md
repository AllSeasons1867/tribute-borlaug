# README

This project deploys the Ruby on Rails framework in order to create a tribute page to Norman Borlaug.

When the application is downloaded to your local machine you will have to configure the database permissions in the database.yml file to be congruent with your system.

Run 'rails db:create' and then 'rails db:migrate' to instantiate the database.

Run the server with the command 'rails s'.

You may view the page that the app serves and peruse at your leisure to learn more about Borlaug. 

The CSS in the site uses @media queries to deliver responsiveness on your device.
